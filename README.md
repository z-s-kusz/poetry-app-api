App no longer serves a purpose since heroku shut off its free tier.

App lives over on sas.js using ```netlify functions```.

Keeping this here as a reminder that free services eventually have a cost.

Netlfiy, please stay free or at least cheep. Herokus 'Eco' 60$ a year option that still needs to be 'woken up' to function is about
5x more than I'd ever be willing to pay for a sleepy server with bad documentation.
